### ----- Test ----- ###
###    21 Jul 2014   ###
###					 ###
########################

- Blank pygame template created.
- Basic folder structure created.


#################################
### ----- Version 0.0.1 ----- ### 
###        22 Jul 2014		  ###
###							  ###
#################################

- Functionality to load images from spritesheets added.
- Added test function to place images randomly on screen
	from a spritesheet.
- Temporary spritesheet image added.


#################################
### ----- Version 0.0.2 ----- ###
###        24 Jul 2014        ###
###							  ###
#################################

-Removed spritesheet test.

-Added temporary function to load and blit images from spritesheet
	by referencing a "level#.dat" file

-Cleaned up some code/re-named some variables.


#################################
### ----- Version 0.0.3 ----- ###
###        25 Jul 2014        ###
###							  ###
#################################

-Transfered tile class and functions to game.py
	Tile class more or less performs the same function as the
	spritesheet.py file, so at the moment spritesheet.py is redundant.

-Added a player sprite that detects tiles. Player cannot
	"hit" or collide with tiles in this build.

-Added event handling to control player movement with arrow keys.


#################################
### ----- Version 0.0.4 ----- ###
###        25 Jul 2014	      ###
###							  ###
#################################

-Added the ability to add both "tiles" and "walls" to differentiate 
	surfaces the player is allowed to walk on and not.
	
- Changed level1.dat to serve for testing/debugging purposes.

-Re-organized the changelog to make it look (and hopefully read) better

-FIXED code that references "level#.dat" file and blits spritesheet images.
	It was mis-reading the code quite badly, and was not bliting images
	on the proper line. This was caused by bad indentation in for loop.
	Also I had the x and y axis reversed in the function.

- Re-arranged a lot of the game.py "to make more sense" (to me anyway)
	Along with this re-paired a lot of redundancy in code

- Added a lot of comments to code/removed "old" ones that no longer apply

- Removed redundant/non-applicable ".py" files. Includes:
	-spritesheet.py
	-tile.py (may re-add later)
	-level.py (may re-add later)

- Feel good about being productive for once. Who knew it I had it in me?


#################################
### ----- Version 0.0.5 ----- ###
###        01 Aug 2014	      ###
###							  ###
#################################

- Edited "loadTile" function in several ways
	-Removed all "magic numbers"
	-Added the ability to choose which spritesheet file tiles are loaded from
	
- Externally searched for/added Sprites for potential future use.


#################################
### ----- Version 0.0.6 ----- ###
###        13 Aug 2014	      ###
###							  ###
#################################

- Added a "tile_reference.txt" to quickly check which characters correspond to
	wall/tile images.

- Edited game.py to start/run from a "game class"
	- Should make it easier to interact with classes in different files

- Re-arranged game.py (again) to make more sense with ^ change
	- Also helped re-familiarize myself after a somewhat long break.

- Externally refined/cut down the massive number of resources to those
	that are most likely to be used later

	
#################################
### ----- Version 0.0.7 ----- ###
###        15 Aug 2014	      ###
###							  ###
#################################

- Project moved to its own PyDev workspace in Eclipse for development

- Removed tiles.py

- Removed old files in Github repo as well to avoid confusion

- Controls are now handled by their own function
	- This means all levels are locked to the same control scheme
		unless manually overwritten for a specific level

- Added level0 and level2.py's to the project, though both are not in their final
	stage, but used for testing
	- Level0 will eventually be the main menu/welcome screen.

- Added the ability to check player sprite coordinates by pressing the "A" key
	(likely only a temporary bind)
	
- Added initial support for switching between levels depending on player position
	- Will later add the ability to switch between levels with a key bind

- Probably did more but everything else wasn't important enough to be remembered
	

#################################
### ----- Version 0.0.8 ----- ###
###        19 Aug 2014	      ###
###							  ###
#################################


- Added a main menu that is now the first screen that appears upon running the game
	and it includes several buttons (although there is no text yet):
		- Controls/How to Play Button
		- Play Button (Functional w/ the test levels created previously)
		- Tutorial Button 
		- Credits (may change later)
		- ***** Planning to ***** add a welcome/hello button up at the top (need asset)
	- Upon start-up one of four temporary backgrounds appears at random 
		- For now buttons are one color, but they will change depending on background image
		- Temporary backgrounds will be replaced by game levels once completed
	- Main Menu has a dedicated/independent control scheme from the rest of the game
	- Added several assets (images) to project for use in Main Menu

- Created a variable to store the version number, and make it much easier to edit
	- Previously stored within the "main()" function
	
- Noticed part of the changelog's format was off (corrected)


#################################
### ----- Version 0.0.9 ----- ###
###        24 Aug 2014	      ###
###							  ###
#################################

- Reinstalled operating system on laptop, so project moved from Eclipse for Win8 to
	Eclipse Luna for Xbuntu. 
	- Had to add a lot of extra "#@UndefinedVariable"'s to the controls() class
		as a result of version differences
		
- Familiarized myself with GIMP Image Editor to perform a few basic tasks related to images
	- As a result corrected some coordinates so that the test tiles coords/sizes are more
		accurate and will look better
	- Successfully made the background of the test spritesheet transparent
	- Removed testSheet() from assets folder as it was redundant/useless

- Added comments and/or made minor changes to
	- loadTiles() function so that it is clear how to add spaces between tiles to create a 
		"grid" appearance
		- Also edited one of the values to change the referenced image
	- levelOne() I made the comments much more clear, and changed a few variables to make
		 more sense
	- levelTwo() so that there are much fewer comments
		- More or less got rid of anything already stated in levelOne()

- Added a to-do/upcoming features part to the bottom/end of the changelog
	(no it isn't centered and I can't bothered to fix it...deal with it)
	- Noticed I'm doing the chagelog completely backward from what is considered "best 
		practice"...also cant' be bothered to change


          ################### Upcoming Features/ To-do ####################
                
- Noticed a bug in controls() where if you are holding a movement key down while a level is
	changing, then movement in that direction will no longer be possible on the next level
		- *Should* be able to fix by adding the ability to return "None" 
			(will add in a later version)
	 	- Could also be I just noticed the bug because of the transfer over to Linux

- Drafted a few levels/ideas on paper for a tutorial/introduction to the game
	- These levels will be the first thing added content-wise
